# AI Tutoring Prototype

This is a prototype of an AI-based tutoring system that uses hierarchical cognition principles and Bayesian updates to model student knowledge.

## Features
- Bayesian modeling of student knowledge levels using Poisson-Gamma conjugate priors
- Hierarchical topic structure with difficulty levels
- Adaptive topic selection based on student performance
- Visualization of belief updates

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python cli.py
```
